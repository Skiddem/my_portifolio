<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> A young, exuberant and self-motivated individual looking to make change in society, particularly in the field of computing.
  I am a Computer Science student nearing the completion of my course and my life is pretty normal...sort of.  
</p>

<p>I am Zambian. I come from a comfortable family; A prayerful and godly mother and a somewhat stoic father. My sister is very secretive about her life.
   We just know she likes nice things. </p>

<p> I lived with my aunty who recently moved to another city. She's more of my second sister than my sister really.</p> 

<p>My ultimate in life is to start my own company, "The Good Human Foundation". A tech company that aims
  at the betterment of lives of people by providing them with state of the art tech products and tools.
  Not only the common people, but even companies spanning across all industries.
